# effective_python

This is a little side-project for refreshing coding in Python, based upon the Book "Effective Python - 59 Specific Wats to write better Python" by Bratt Slatkin.

## Chapter1: Pythonic Thinking
The first chapter of the book describes the very nuances of how to code the proper python-style. "Python programmers prefer to be explicit, to choose simple over complex, and to maximize readibilty."

*bytes_or_str.py*: Introducing the differences of bytes, str and unicode and how to deal with them. In bytes_or_str.py you'll find a handler that deals with both bytes and strings.

*helper_functiions.py*: deals with the necessity of using helper-functions to maintain better readability.
